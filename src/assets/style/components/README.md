# COMPONENTS

**This directory is not required , so you can remove it , if you want**

The components directory contains the scss components of your app if you have one.

keep in mind that your components should be implemented in vue components , if you have a specific component that you can't implement it in vue , you can implement in here.

attention: raising your scss components increase page load time.
