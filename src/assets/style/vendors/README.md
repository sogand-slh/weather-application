# VENDORS

**This directory is not required , so you can remove it , if you want**

The vendors directory contains any third-party stylesheets a project uses. For instance, if we wanted to use Bootstrap alongside our own custom Scss in a project, we'd download the Bootstrap stylesheet and place it here.
